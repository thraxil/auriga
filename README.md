Playing around with some ideas around remote presentations. The idea
is that you can author a presentation here, share the URL with
someone, then advance slides from your browser and it will advance in
theirs as well (through the magic of websockets/liveview). This is
much faster and more efficient than, eg, sharing your screen in Zoom
while you go through a slide deck.

(there's also a separate chat room feature that was initially just me
figuring out how liveview/channels works but I might turn into a
backchannel feature on presentations).
